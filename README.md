spamc-filter
============

A pipeline for integrating spamc, spamassassin SQL user prefs and Postfix.

Usage
-----

     spamc-filter --sender=[sender] --recipient=[recipient]

spamc-filter is called with two mandatory arguments, the sender and recipient(s) of the email to be piped to spamc.  The filter attempts to work out the most appropriate user to run spamc as before passing the message on.

Knowing the user allows spamc to fetch the user settings from the SQL source.

Typically this can be used by adding the following line to your Postfix configuration in /etc/postfix/master.cf:

     spamassassin unix -     n       n       -       -       pipe user=spamd argv=/usr/local/bin/spamc-filter --sender=${sender} --recipient=${recipient}

It is also recommended to set the maximum recipients to 1 in /etc/postfix/main.cf:

     spamassassin_destination_recipient_limit=1
